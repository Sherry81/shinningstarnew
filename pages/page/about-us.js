    //               of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they
    //               cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue;
    //               and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty
    //               through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through
    //               shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple
    //               and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of
    //               choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being
    //               able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed
    //               and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing
    //               to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will
    //               frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and
    //               annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in
    //               these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects
    //               pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he
    //               endures pains to avoid worse pains.
